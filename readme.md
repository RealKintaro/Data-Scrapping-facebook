# Fine classification of offensive content written in Arabic dialect on Facebook and visualization

the main goal of this project is to classify offensive content written in Arabic dialect (Egyptian dialect, Levantine dialect, Gulf dialect, and Moroccan dialect) on Facebook and visualize the results.

## Definition of offensive content
Offensive content is content that reasonably causes another to experience extreme anger, insult, or disrespect.
Examples of offensive content
- Content that is threatening, harassing, or incites violence.

## Hate speech
Hate speech often emerges from an “us vs. them” conceptual framework, in which individuals differentiate the group they believe they belong to, or the “in-group,” from the “out-group.” Hate speech toward the out-groups is segmented into three major categories in this analysis.

#### - Dehumanization and demonization
Dehumanization involves belittling groups and equating them to culturally despised subhuman entities, such as pigs, rats, monkeys, or even germs or dirt/filth.  A widely known recent manifestation of this phenomena involved calling the Tutsi minority in Rwanda cockroaches in the lead up and during the 1994 genocide.

Demonization, on the other hand, involves portraying a group as superhuman, like a monster, robot, or even fatal diseases like cancer that are a mortal threat to the in-group.
 - Racism
 - Sexism (Misogyny,Misandry)
 - religion off (againt religion)

## - Varbal abuse

Verbal abuse (also known as verbal aggression, verbal attack, verbal violence, verbal assault, psychic aggression, or psychic violence) is a type of psychological/mental abuse that involves the use of oral, gestured, and written language directed to a victim. Verbal abuse can include the act of harassing, labeling, insulting, scolding, rebuking, or excessive yelling towards an individual. It can also include the use of derogatory terms, the delivery of statements intended to frighten, humiliate, denigrate, or belittle a person. These kinds of attacks may result in mental and/or emotional distress for the victim.
